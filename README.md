# Digital Components in Python using myHDL

## Overview
This project contains a set of basic digital components implemented in Python using the myHDL library. The myHDL package converts Python code to Verilog synthesizable code, making it suitable for hardware description and synthesis.

These components were created as part of a Computer Organization and Architecture course, and they serve as tangible examples of key concepts in digital layout.


## Requirements
To run these components, you will need:
- Python installed on your system
- The myHDL library (install via pip: `pip install myhdl`)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the component you want to use.
3. Run the Python script corresponding to the component.
